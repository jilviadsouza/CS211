Computer Architecture at Rutgers University


pa1 - Introduction to C. Includes multiple basic programs implementing data structures in C. 

pa2 - Machine Learning with C. Includes a program that predicts house prices based on historical data. 

pa3 - Bit Manipulation. Includes multiple programs using bit operations. 

pa4 - NOT UPLOADED. Bomb Lab that required us to analyze multiple 'stages' of x86 Assembly code to diffuse bombs at each stage. No code required, just analysis. 

pa5 - Assembly Interpreter. Includes a program that interprets x86 assembly code. 

pa6 - Cache Simulator. Includes a program that implements a cache simulator that evaluates different configurations of caches against different trace files. 

pa7 - Circuit Simulator. Includes a program that implements a circuit simulator that reads a circuit description file and returns the output of the circuit in the form of a truth table.
